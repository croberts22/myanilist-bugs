# MyAniList Bug Tracker üêõ

This is a public repository used to track issues for the 3rd party AniList app, [MyAniList](https://myanilist.app). If you have a bug to report, you can check the [Issues](https://github.com/croberts22/myanilist-bugs/issues) tab to see if someone else has reported it. Since feedback is often filed in separate, disparate areas (like Discord, email, and Fider), I wanted to create a canonical source where people can report and view any outstanding bugs that have been ticketed. I can't promise I can get to all of them immediately, but it'll help me figure out which issues have been impacting people the most! Plus, I want to know what issues you've encountered that I might not have found!

### Awesome, so how do I report a bug?

In order to create a report through the issue tracker, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). It's free! ü•≥ 

Once you've done that, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/croberts22/myanilist-bugs/issues) tab near the top of this repository, select "New Issue," and then fill out the form. Please fill in as much information as you can! Reproducible steps, screenshots, or videos are wonderful ways for me to understand how you ran into a bug. 

Also, **Please** be courteous and civil when discussing bugs in the issue tracker.

### How do I find out if my bug has already been reported?

Simply go to the [Issues](https://github.com/croberts22/myanilist-bugs/issues) tab at the top and use the search bar to search to see if the issue already exists. If it doesn't, please file a report! Otherwise, feel free to react to an existing issue to let me know it's impacting you too. You can also supply additional information in the comments if you think the issue can be manifested in more than one way.

### If it's been reported, how can I help you fix it?

As I mentioned, any information on how to reproduce the issue is the best way to help me! If you can record a video on iOS demonstrating how to reach the issue, or if you have thorough steps, I can easily try to reproduce that on my side. 

Sometimes, bugs aren't always 100% reproducible. Letting me know how often you think it happens (i.e. "I can get the screen to crash on this anime 2 out of 5 times"), then that also helps! Any information is helpful. üôÇ

### Why Github?

[Github](https://github.com/) is a great website used by developers to publish code, documentation, issues, and releases. It helps cut down on a lot of the noise that often shows up in Discord and the numerous emails I get through in-app feedback. Because I'm in grad school and also work full-time, it's difficult for me to keep up on everyone's thoughtful feedback. Keeping things enumerated here really helps me out! 

It's really easy and quick to sign up for an account, and it only helps the app get better over time! I promise. üôÇ

### What if I have a feature request instead?

Check out our [feature request](https://fider.myanilist.app/) page!

### Can I participate in discussions here?

Participation is encouraged! However, like I mentioned before, please be courteous, civil, and on-topic. Please don't add memes, mention people deliberately unnecessarily, or slander anyone. If you want to let me know that you're witnessing the same issue, please use the `+` button with the smiley on it to react with an emoji on an issue, versus saying "+1" or "me too". These comments will be deleted as they are just spam. 

tl;dr: be nice. üôÇ
